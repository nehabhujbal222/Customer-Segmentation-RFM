**- Neha Bhujbal**

**Dataset:** Sprocket Central Pty Ltd Data Set

This project is a part of my KPMG Data Analytics Consulting Virtual Internship experience. The aim is to analyse the Sprocket Central dataset which contains data about the bicycle company and its sales and identify which New Customers (specifically) and Existing Customers (additional) the company should target to improve it's sales and maximize profits.

**Project Goal:**
1. Capture key business metrics (KPIs) measuring customer behaviour related to Transactions and Products.
2. Identify and segment Customers using Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value (RFM) approach.
3. Based on the results, specify who Sprocket Central Pty Ltd' should be targeting out of the new 1000 customer list. 

**Workflow:**
1. **Data quality assessment-** Assessed the quality of data, achieved completeness in preparation for analysis.
2. **Data Insights-** Used RFM customer segmentation technique to target high value customers based on customer demographics and attributes.
3. **Data Insights and Presentation-** Using visualizations to provide insights. Designed a dashboard using Tableau to summarize the results and delivered a presentation.

**Analytics tools used:**

The segmentation based on different business metrics will thus help the marketing and sales, account management and product teams to support better their customers and improve the product offering, availability and recommendations.
